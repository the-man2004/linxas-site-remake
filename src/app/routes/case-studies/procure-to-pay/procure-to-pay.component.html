        With over half a century of glass manufacturing experience in South
        Africa, Consol has a heritage that is truly South African and assumes
        its position as industry leader with pride. From early beginnings at a
        small glass manufacturing plant in Natal in the early 1940â€™s, Consol has
        enjoyed steady growth over the years and is the leading glass packaging
        manufacturer in South Africa with a market share of 79%, exporting glass
        packaging to 17 African countries. Previously a listed company, Consol
        Limited officially became Consol Glass (Pty) in April 2007, after a
        successful takeover bid led by private equity firm Brait. Employing some
        1,800 employees and headquartered in Johannesburg, Consol brings
        significant expertise to the glass packaging industry.
