        “With the implementation of this solution, the client has graduated from
        the obsolete world of passwords to a far more controlled environment of
        biometric identity management. The client has a far better understanding
        of when and how each user had access to their SAP system. The project
        has been a complete success.”

        KPMG was retained by a manufacturing client (division of a
        multi-national firm) to identify and implement upgraded security for its
        SAP ECC6 installation. The solution had to cover many locations and a
        substantial SAP user group. KPMG recommended that a major change, using
        SAP-centric biometric identity management, was the best course to
        follow.

      <p class="mb-5 text-lg lg:text-xl lg:gap-10">
        The most important first step in securing an SAP installation is to take
        control of perimeter access. Username/password combinations alone do not
        provide identity management – only biometric authentication can do that.
        As a baseline, all current employees with SAP access are enrolled
        biometrically, effectively stepping up security to a mandatory 2-factor
        process. The abuse or sharing of passwords, whether voluntary or covert,
        is thereby alleviated, as each perimeter access transaction becomes a
        logged event, indisputably identifying the actual user.
