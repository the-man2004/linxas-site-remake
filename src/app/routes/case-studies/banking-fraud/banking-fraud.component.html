      <h3 class="my-5 font-semibold text-lg lg:text-xl">Major Objectives</h3>

      <p class="mb-5 text-lg lg:text-xl lg:gap-10">
        A major international bank required biometric security capabilities
        natively embedded in their SAP system as part of their internal checks
        and balances requirements. Extensive and successful proof-of-concept and
        penetration testing was performed before deciding on the implementation.
        Preventing insider fraud and ensuring compliance with internal
        procedures were also key drivers.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5 text-lg lg:text-xl lg:gap-10">
        Areas to be secured included customer-facing personnel who would have
        access to depositors’ information. Also, inventory movement of funds and
        precious metals between vaults, recycling of old banknotes and such
        high-risk activities were high priority areas.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5 text-lg lg:text-xl lg:gap-10">
        Automatic logging of restricted activities was required to assist with
        regulatory compliance.
      </p>

          Ability to set threshold field values in certain transactions, above
          which threshold biometric re-authentication is triggered
        </li>
        <li>
          Silent e-mail alerts and tamper-proof logging of failed activities
          indicating possible overstepping of a user’s credentials, providing a
          forensic trail
