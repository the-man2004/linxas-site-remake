        “We are seeing an increasing number of high-profile security breaches in
        the recent past. Apart from legislative challenges, SAP customers in
        general are facing more skilled and ruthless opportunists that will do
        anything to get unauthorized access to data and funds. By introducing
        bioLock biometric SAP security we have implemented a solution that
        cannot be circumvented in any way. We are really pleased to offer this

        A major social services agency with millions of beneficiaries, whether
        for pensions, workers’ compensation, or other forms of social
        assistance, becomes a target for various forms of fraud. Addressing and
        preventing fraudulent activities on behalf of the agency’s stakeholders
        takes place on many levels, first within the agency’s employees and
        their outside business partners, and then at the level of the
        beneficiaries themselves.
